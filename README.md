My introduction to Association Rule Mining

# Context
Online retail company XYZ sells various products and looking to increase its revenue by <b>promoting cross-selling</b> (i.e. selling related or complementary items) opportunities to its customers. The company is looking to apply advanced analytics on its historical transactional data to answer the following <b>business question:</b>

When a customer buys an item, what are the <i>related or complementary items</i> that can be presented to them to promote cross-selling?

# Project

1) <b>Machine Learning:</b> Generate frequent itemsets and association rules for a recommender system using Association Rule Mining. <i>Feel free to choose appropriate levels of minimum support and minimum confidence (e.g., 0.20 support and 30% confidence).</i>

2) <b>Insights:</b> Make two business recommendations to deliver business outcomes from this association rule based recommender system. 

3) <b>Research:</b> Identify three additional business use cases where Association Rule Mining can be used to deliver business outcomes?
